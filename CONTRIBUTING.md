## Code Review Process

The project maintainers will review all pull requests. During the review, maintainers may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments.

## Core Development Principles

1. **Cross-Language Compatibility**: All changes must maintain compatibility across supported languages
2. **Performance Sensitivity**: Be mindful of performance overhead in implementation
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Avoid breaking changes to existing APIs
4. **Security First**: Consider security implications of all changes
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: All features must have thorough tests
