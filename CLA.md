# Contributor License Agreement

This Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is a placeholder for the full CLA that will be implemented in the future.

## Purpose

The Contributor License Agreement allows the Universal Integration Protocol project to:

1. Accept community contributions while maintaining its dual licensing model
2. Use contributions in both open-source and commercial contexts
3. Ensure all contributions are properly licensed and documented

## CLA Implementation Timeline

The full CLA will be implemented during the Pre-MVP Development phase and will be required for all contributors before their pull requests can be merged.

## Planned CLA Terms

The CLA will require contributors to:

1. Grant a copyright license to their contributions
2. Certify they have the right to grant such a license
3. Allow the project to use their contributions in both open-source and commercial contexts
4. Permit relicensing of their contributions as needed

## Temporary Contribution Process

Until the CLA is fully implemented:

1. By submitting a pull request, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's AGPL-3.0 license
2. You certify that you have the right to submit the contribution under these terms
3. You understand that a formal CLA will be required in the future
